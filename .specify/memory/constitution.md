# Test Case Generator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All logic MUST be simple, concise, and avoid unnecessary complexity. Code MUST prioritize
clarity and maintainability over clever solutions. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles
MUST be applied rigorously—do not build features until they are actually required.

**Rationale**: Complex code is harder to test, debug, and maintain. Simple code reduces
cognitive load, accelerates onboarding, and minimizes defects. In test case generation,
clarity ensures generated tests are understandable and maintainable.

**Rules**:

- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Use descriptive naming that reveals intent
- Break down complex functions into smaller, single-purpose units
- Avoid premature optimization
- Reject unnecessary abstractions or design patterns
- Each component MUST have a clear, singular purpose

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All implementations MUST be fully testable. Unit tests MUST be written for isolated functions.
Integration tests MUST verify component interactions. TDD workflow is MANDATORY:
Write tests → Review tests → Ensure tests fail → Implement → Verify tests pass → Refactor.

**Rationale**: Testing is not an afterthought but the foundation of reliable software. For a
test case generator, dogfooding our own testing principles ensures we build quality tooling.
Tests serve as executable documentation and prevent regressions.

**Rules**:

- Every function MUST have corresponding unit tests
- Integration tests MUST cover component boundaries and interactions
- Tests MUST be written and approved BEFORE implementation begins
- Tests MUST fail initially (Red phase) to prove they work
- Code coverage targets: minimum 80% for unit tests, 70% for integration tests
- Test names MUST clearly describe the scenario being tested
- Mock external dependencies appropriately to isolate units

### III. Modular Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All features MUST be built using modular, independent, and reusable components. Each component
MUST be self-contained with clearly defined interfaces. Components MUST NOT have tight coupling
to other components.

**Rationale**: Modularity enables parallel development, independent testing, easier maintenance,
and code reuse. Components can be composed, replaced, or extended without cascading changes.
This is critical for a test case generator that may support multiple testing frameworks and
languages.

**Rules**:

- Each module MUST expose a clear, documented public API
- Modules MUST communicate through defined interfaces, not internal implementation details
- Shared functionality MUST be extracted to separate, reusable libraries
- Avoid circular dependencies between modules
- Each module MUST be independently testable
- Module boundaries MUST align with domain concepts (e.g., parser, generator, validator)

### IV. Comprehensive Documentation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every root component folder MUST contain its own README.md explaining its specific purpose,
API, and usage examples. The main project README.md MUST explain how features fit into the
high-level architecture. Code MUST include inline comments for complex logic.

**Documentation Synchronization (CRITICAL)**: Every code change—whether implementing new
features, fixing bugs, refactoring, or any modification—MUST include updates to ALL related
documentation in the same commit/PR. Outdated documentation is considered a defect.

**Rationale**: Documentation is essential for onboarding, maintenance, and collaboration.
Without clear documentation, even simple code becomes opaque over time. For a test generator
project, documentation ensures users understand how to integrate and extend the tooling.
Synchronized documentation prevents drift and maintains trust in the documentation.

**Rules**:

- Root-level README.md MUST include: project overview, architecture diagram, setup instructions,
  usage examples, contribution guidelines
- Component README.md MUST include: purpose statement, API documentation, usage examples,
  dependencies, testing instructions
- Public APIs MUST have docstrings or equivalent documentation describing parameters, return
  values, and side effects
- Non-obvious code logic MUST include inline comments explaining the "why"
- Examples MUST be runnable and tested
- **Code-Documentation Sync Rules**:
  - New feature → Update component README, main README (if architecture changes), API docs,
    examples, and any affected specification documents
  - Bug fix → Update inline comments if logic changes, README troubleshooting section if
    relevant, and changelog
  - Refactoring → Update API docs if signatures change, README if usage patterns change,
    architecture diagrams if structure changes
  - Breaking changes → Update ALL documentation mentioning the changed API/behavior, add
    migration guide
  - Performance improvements → Update README performance characteristics, benchmark docs
  - Deprecated features → Add deprecation notices in docs, provide migration paths
- **Documentation Review Checklist** (required for all PRs):
  - [ ] Component README updated
  - [ ] Main README updated (if architectural impact)
  - [ ] API documentation updated (if public interfaces changed)
  - [ ] Code comments updated (if logic changed)
  - [ ] Examples updated (if usage changed)
  - [ ] Changelog entry added
  - [ ] Migration guide added (if breaking changes)

### V. Incremental Delivery & User Story Independence

Features MUST be broken down into independently implementable and testable user stories. Each
user story MUST deliver standalone value and be prioritized (P1, P2, P3...). Implementation
MUST proceed incrementally, with each story producing a demonstrable MVP slice.

**Rationale**: Incremental delivery enables faster feedback, reduces risk, and allows pivoting
based on learnings. Independent stories can be developed in parallel and delivered separately.
This aligns with Agile principles and ensures continuous value delivery.

**Rules**:

- User stories MUST be prioritized based on business value and dependencies
- Each story MUST be testable independently
- P1 stories form the core MVP and MUST be completed first
- No story should block multiple other stories (minimize dependencies)
- Each story completion MUST result in a working, demonstrable feature increment
- Stories MUST map to task phases in tasks.md

## Documentation Requirements

### Repository Structure

All projects MUST follow a consistent structure:

- `/src` or language-specific source directories for implementation code
- `/tests` with subdirectories: `/unit`, `/integration`, `/contract`
- `/docs` for comprehensive documentation beyond README files
- `/specs` for feature specifications, plans, and design documents
- Component folders MUST include component-specific README.md files

### Documentation Standards

- All README files MUST use Markdown format
- API documentation MUST follow language-specific conventions (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
- Architecture diagrams MUST be included in the main README for non-trivial projects
- Examples MUST be practical, complete, and executable
- Version history and changelogs MUST be maintained

### Documentation Synchronization Standard (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Principle**: Documentation and code MUST evolve together in the same commit/pull request.

**Affected Documents by Change Type**:

| Change Type | Documents to Update |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **New Feature** | Component README, Main README (architecture), API docs, Usage examples, Spec docs |
| **Bug Fix** | Inline comments (if logic changes), README troubleshooting, Changelog, Related specs |
| **Refactoring** | API docs (if signatures change), README (if usage changes), Architecture diagrams |
| **Breaking Change** | ALL affected docs, Migration guide, Deprecation notices, Changelog (BREAKING) |
| **Performance** | README performance section, Benchmark docs, Technical specifications |
| **Deprecation** | Deprecation notices in all docs, Migration paths, Alternative recommendations |
| **Configuration** | README setup section, Configuration docs, Environment variable docs |
| **Dependencies** | README prerequisites, Installation docs, Dependency justification |

**Enforcement**:

- Pull requests with code changes but no doc updates MUST be rejected
- Documentation Gate in code review MUST verify all related docs updated
- Automated checks SHOULD flag PRs with code changes but no doc file changes
- Changelog MUST include entry for every merged PR

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Specification Phase**: Create feature specification with prioritized user stories
2. **Planning Phase**: Develop implementation plan with architecture and technical decisions
3. **Task Breakdown**: Decompose into dependency-ordered tasks organized by user story
4. **Test-First Implementation**: Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement
5. **Review Phase**: Code review for adherence to constitution and quality standards
6. **Documentation Phase**: Update all relevant documentation and examples
7. **Integration Phase**: Verify integration tests and end-to-end workflows

### Constitution Compliance Gates

All feature work MUST pass these gates before merging:

- **Simplicity Gate**: Code reviewed for unnecessary complexity or abstractions
- **Testing Gate**: All tests written first, passed, with adequate coverage
- **Modularity Gate**: Components are independent, reusable, with clear interfaces
- **Documentation Gate**: All required documentation is complete, accurate, and synchronized
  with code changes (use Documentation Review Checklist)
- **Story Independence Gate**: Each user story is independently testable and delivers value

### Quality Standards

- Code MUST pass linting and formatting checks
- All tests MUST pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Breaking changes MUST be documented and versioned appropriately
- Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed before merging

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Adherence to
these principles is MANDATORY for all contributions.

### Amendment Process

1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented with clear rationale
2. Amendments MUST be reviewed by project maintainers
3. Breaking amendments (principle removal/redefinition) require MAJOR version bump
4. New principles or expanded guidance require MINOR version bump
5. Clarifications and non-semantic changes require PATCH version bump
6. All amendments MUST include a migration plan for existing code if applicable
7. Updated constitution MUST sync with all template files

### Compliance & Review

- All pull requests MUST verify constitution compliance
- Complexity MUST be explicitly justified in implementation plans
- Template files MUST align with constitution principles
- Regular constitution reviews MUST occur to ensure relevance

### Version Control

Constitution changes MUST follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible governance or principle changes
- **MINOR**: New principles or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic updates

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-25 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-25
