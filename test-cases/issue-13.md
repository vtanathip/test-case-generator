# Test Cases: Feature Request: User Login

## Overview
This feature request includes a user login system with various requirements and edge cases to ensure secure and efficient user authentication.

## Prerequisites
- A functional web application or API for testing
- Sample user data (at least 2 users, including a valid and invalid account)
- Access to the developer console for error analysis

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: [Happy Path - Normal Flow]
**Given**: User has a valid username and password.
**When**: User attempts to log in with the credentials.
**Then**: Redirected to the dashboard.

**Test Steps**:
1. Log in using a valid username and password (e.g., "user123" and "password123").
2. Verify that the page redirects to the expected location ("dashboard").
3. Check for any error messages or flash messages indicating success.

### Scenario 2: [Edge Case - Boundary Conditions]
**Given**: User has an invalid username (empty, very long).
**When**: User attempts to log in with the invalid credentials.
**Then**: Shows validation errors and does not redirect.

**Test Steps**:
1. Log in using an empty username (e.g., "") or a very long username (e.g., "a" repeated 20 times).
2. Verify that the page displays a validation error message for the username field.
3. Check if the page redirects to an error page or displays an error message.

### Scenario 3: [Error Handling - Invalid Input]
**Given**: User has invalid or missing password.
**When**: System checks for valid password and displays an error message.
**Then**: Shows clear actionable error messages.

**Test Steps**:
1. Log in using an invalid password (e.g., a short string).
2. Verify that the page displays a validation error message for the password field.
3. Check if the system provides clear, actionable instructions on how to correct the error.

### Scenario 4: [Edge Case - Special Characters]
**Given**: User attempts to log in with special characters in username or password.
**When**: System handles edge cases correctly and does not redirect.
**Then**: Does not display any critical errors.

**Test Steps**:
1. Log in using a username containing special characters (e.g., "user!@#$").
2. Verify that the system handles the input without displaying critical errors.
3. Check if the page remains stable during login attempts.

### Scenario 5: [Edge Case - SQL Injection Attempt]
**Given**: User attempts to inject malicious SQL code into username or password field.
**When**: System detects and prevents potential security risks.
**Then**: Blocks the user's IP address for a specified time period.

**Test Steps**:
1. Log in using an attempt at SQL injection (e.g., "SELECT * FROM users").
2. Verify that the system blocks the user's IP address after detecting an attempted injection.
3. Check the logs for failed login attempts and ensure they are properly logged and analyzed.

### Scenario 6: [Edge Case - Account Lockout]
**Given**: User exceeds maximum allowed failed login attempts (5) within a specified time period (15 minutes).
**When**: System locks out the user's account.
**Then**: Displays an error message indicating account lockout.

**Test Steps**:
1. Log in with incorrect credentials 4 times to reach the maximum allowed attempts.
2. Wait for the specified time period (15 minutes) and attempt another login.
3. Verify that the system displays an error message indicating account lockout.

## Test Data

```json
{
    "valid_credentials": {
        "username": "user123",
        "password": "password123"
    },
    "invalid_username": {
        "username": "",
        "password": "password123"
    },
    "invalid_password": {
        "username": "user123",
        "password": "short_string"
    }
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All happy path scenarios pass
- [ ] Edge cases handled correctly
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security considerations addressed

## Notes

This test plan aims to cover all aspects of the user login feature, including happy paths, edge cases, error handling, performance, and security. The comprehensive set of tests ensures that users can securely log in to the system while preventing potential security risks and ensuring system stability during high load scenarios.
