# Test Cases: Feature Request: User Login

## Overview
This set of tests covers all aspects of a user login feature, including happy path scenarios, edge cases, error handling, and performance. The goal is to ensure that the system behaves as expected under various conditions.

## Prerequisites
- A working user account with valid credentials
- Access to a testing environment or simulation
- Test data in JSON format (see below)

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path - Normal Flow
**Given**: User logs into their account
**When**: Successful login attempt is made
**Then**: Redirected to dashboard page with user's profile information

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Enter a valid username (e.g., "testuser") and password (e.g., "password123").
3. Check if the system redirects to the dashboard page without any errors.

### Scenario 2: Edge Case - Boundary Conditions
**Given**: User enters maximum allowed characters in username field
**When**: Maximum characters are used
**Then**: System accepts the input without errors

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Enter a username with exactly 20 characters (e.g., "verylongusername").
3. Check if the system accepts the input without displaying any validation errors.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case - Boundary Conditions
**Given**: User enters minimum allowed characters in password field
**When**: Minimum characters are used
**Then**: System accepts the input without errors

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Enter a password with exactly 8 characters (e.g., "password").
3. Check if the system accepts the input without displaying any validation errors.

### Scenario 4: Error Handling - Invalid Input
**Given**: User enters invalid username or password
**When**: Invalid credentials are entered
**Then**: System displays an error message

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Enter a valid username and an incorrect password (e.g., "testuserwrong").
3. Check if the system displays an error message indicating that the credentials are invalid.

### Scenario 5: Error Handling - Invalid Input
**Given**: User leaves both fields empty
**When**: Empty fields are entered
**Then**: System displays validation errors

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Leave both the username and password fields empty.
3. Check if the system displays error messages indicating that the fields cannot be left empty.

### Scenario 6: Edge Case - Remember Me
**Given**: User checks "Remember me" checkbox
**When**: Login attempt is made with remember me enabled
**Then**: System logs user in automatically on subsequent visits

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Check the "Remember me" checkbox before entering valid credentials (e.g., "testuserpassword").
3. Log out of the system and then log back in without checking the remember me box.
4. Verify that the user is automatically logged in.

### Scenario 7: Edge Case - Very Long Input Strings
**Given**: User enters very long input strings in both fields
**When**: Maximum allowed characters are used
**Then**: System displays an error message

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Enter a very long username (e.g., "verylongusernameverylong") and password (e.g., "verylongpasswordverylong").
3. Check if the system displays an error message indicating that the input exceeds the allowed length.

### Scenario 8: Edge Case - Special Characters
**Given**: User enters special characters in username or password
**When**: Special characters are used
**Then**: System accepts the input without errors

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Enter a valid username with special characters (e.g., "testuser!@#").
3. Verify that the system accepts the input without displaying any validation errors.

### Scenario 9: Edge Case - Case Sensitivity
**Given**: User enters username or password in different cases
**When**: Different cases are used
**Then**: System treats case-insensitive

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the application and navigate to the login form.
2. Enter a valid username with different cases (e.g., "testuser" and "TESTUSER").
3. Verify that the system accepts both inputs without displaying any validation errors.

### Scenario 10: Performance/Load
**Given**: High load or stress conditions are applied
**When**: System performance is measured under load
**Then**: System remains stable with acceptable response times

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate a high load on the system by opening multiple instances of the application.
2. Measure and record the system's response time for each login attempt.
3. Verify that the system remains stable and responsive.

## Test Data

```json
{
  "example_input": {
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123"
  },
  "expected_output": {
    "redirect_url": "/dashboard",
    "error_message": null,
    "system_status": "ok"
  }
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- All happy path scenarios pass
- Edge cases are handled correctly
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Performance meets requirements
- Security considerations are addressed
