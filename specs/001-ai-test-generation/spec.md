# Feature Specification: AI Test Case Generation System

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-test-generation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "generate a complete project and technical architecture for an AI test case generation system using GitHub Issues, Webhooks, Cloudflare Tunnel, LangGraph, and a Vector DB to automatically create a PR with Markdown test cases, including the architecture summary, workflow, LangGraph code structure, multimodal prompt template, and Markdown output format, and testable, make sure everything need to simplify no fancy features."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: How long should the system retain generated test cases in the vector database before archival or deletion? → A: 30 days (balanced retention for recent context)
- Q: When the AI service fails or times out during test case generation, what retry strategy should the system use? → A: Exponential backoff (retry 3 times with increasing delays: 5s, 15s, 45s)
- Q: What is the maximum character limit for issue descriptions that the system will process? → A: 5,000 characters (generous limit, detailed descriptions allowed)
- Q: How should the system handle duplicate webhook deliveries from GitHub (same issue event received multiple times)? → A: Idempotency check with 1-hour cache (track processed issue+event combinations for 1 hour)
- Q: What level of observability should the system implement for monitoring and debugging? → A: Structured logging with correlation IDs (trace requests through entire workflow with JSON logs)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Test Case Generation from GitHub Issue (Priority: P1)

A developer creates a GitHub issue with a specific tag (e.g., "generate-tests"), and the system automatically analyzes the issue content and generates comprehensive test cases in Markdown format as a pull request.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality that delivers immediate value by automating test case creation, reducing manual effort, and ensuring test coverage consistency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a tagged GitHub issue, verifying the webhook triggers, and confirming that a PR with test cases is created within expected time (e.g., under 2 minutes).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitHub repository with the system configured, **When** a developer creates an issue with the tag "generate-tests" and issue body containing feature description, **Then** the system triggers automatically within 10 seconds
2. **Given** the system has been triggered by a tagged issue, **When** the AI processes the issue content, **Then** a new branch is created with generated test cases in Markdown format
3. **Given** test cases have been generated, **When** the generation completes successfully, **Then** a pull request is automatically created linking back to the original issue
4. **Given** a pull request with test cases is created, **When** the developer views the PR, **Then** the test cases follow a standard Markdown format with clear test scenarios, expected outcomes, and edge cases

### User Story 2 - Issue Content Analysis and Context Retrieval (Priority: P2)

When a tagged issue is created, the system analyzes the issue content, retrieves relevant context from a vector database (previous test cases, code patterns, similar issues), and uses this context to generate more accurate and comprehensive test cases.

**Why this priority**: Context-aware generation significantly improves test case quality and relevance, but the system can function with basic generation in P1.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating issues with similar content and verifying that generated test cases reference or incorporate patterns from previous similar issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a vector database containing historical test cases and issue patterns, **When** a new issue is created, **Then** the system retrieves the top 5 most relevant historical test cases for context
2. **Given** retrieved context from the vector database, **When** test case generation occurs, **Then** the generated test cases incorporate relevant patterns and avoid duplication
3. **Given** an issue with ambiguous requirements, **When** similar historical issues exist, **Then** the system uses those patterns to make informed assumptions documented in the test cases

---

### User Story 3 - Webhook Security and Request Validation (Priority: P3)

The system securely receives webhook requests from GitHub, validates the authenticity using signature verification, and processes only legitimate requests to prevent unauthorized access or malicious triggers.

**Why this priority**: Essential for production security but can be simplified or deferred for initial MVP testing in controlled environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending webhook requests with valid and invalid signatures, verifying that only authenticated requests are processed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a webhook request from GitHub, **When** the request includes a valid signature, **Then** the system processes the webhook and triggers test case generation
2. **Given** a webhook request with an invalid or missing signature, **When** the system receives the request, **Then** the request is rejected with appropriate logging
3. **Given** a webhook request for an unsupported event type, **When** the system receives the request, **Then** the request is acknowledged but no action is taken

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an issue is created without sufficient information for test case generation?
- How does the system handle concurrent issue creation (multiple issues created simultaneously)?
- What happens if the GitHub API rate limit is exceeded during PR creation?
- How does the system handle failure to create a branch or pull request due to permissions?
- What happens when the vector database is unavailable or returns no relevant context?
- Issues with descriptions exceeding 5,000 characters are truncated with a warning comment added to the issue indicating the truncation
- If the AI service fails or times out during generation, the system retries up to 3 times using exponential backoff (5s, 15s, 45s delays), then comments failure on the issue if all retries are exhausted
- Duplicate webhook deliveries are detected using an idempotency cache that tracks processed issue+event combinations for 1 hour, preventing duplicate PR creation

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
