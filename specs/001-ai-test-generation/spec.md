# Feature Specification: AI Test Case Generation System

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-test-generation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "generate a complete project and technical architecture for an AI test case generation system using GitHub Issues, Webhooks, Cloudflare Tunnel, LangGraph, and a Vector DB to automatically create a PR with Markdown test cases, including the architecture summary, workflow, LangGraph code structure, multimodal prompt template, and Markdown output format, and testable, make sure everything need to simplify no fancy features."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: How long should the system retain generated test cases in the vector database before archival or deletion? → A: 30 days (balanced retention for recent context)
- Q: When the AI service fails or times out during test case generation, what retry strategy should the system use? → A: Exponential backoff (retry 3 times with increasing delays: 5s, 15s, 45s)
- Q: What is the maximum character limit for issue descriptions that the system will process? → A: 5,000 characters (generous limit, detailed descriptions allowed)
- Q: How should the system handle duplicate webhook deliveries from GitHub (same issue event received multiple times)? → A: Idempotency check with 1-hour cache (track processed issue+event combinations for 1 hour)
- Q: What level of observability should the system implement for monitoring and debugging? → A: Structured logging with correlation IDs (trace requests through entire workflow with JSON logs)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Test Case Generation from GitHub Issue (Priority: P1)

A developer creates a GitHub issue with a specific tag (e.g., "generate-tests"), and the system automatically analyzes the issue content and generates comprehensive test cases in Markdown format as a pull request.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality that delivers immediate value by automating test case creation, reducing manual effort, and ensuring test coverage consistency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a tagged GitHub issue, verifying the webhook triggers, and confirming that a PR with test cases is created within expected time (e.g., under 2 minutes).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitHub repository with the system configured, **When** a developer creates an issue with the tag "generate-tests" and issue body containing feature description, **Then** the system triggers automatically within 10 seconds
2. **Given** the system has been triggered by a tagged issue, **When** the AI processes the issue content, **Then** a new branch is created with generated test cases in Markdown format
3. **Given** test cases have been generated, **When** the generation completes successfully, **Then** a pull request is automatically created linking back to the original issue
4. **Given** a pull request with test cases is created, **When** the developer views the PR, **Then** the test cases follow a standard Markdown format with clear test scenarios, expected outcomes, and edge cases

---

### User Story 2 - Issue Content Analysis and Context Retrieval (Priority: P2)

When a tagged issue is created, the system analyzes the issue content, retrieves relevant context from a vector database (previous test cases, code patterns, similar issues), and uses this context to generate more accurate and comprehensive test cases.

**Why this priority**: Context-aware generation significantly improves test case quality and relevance, but the system can function with basic generation in P1.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating issues with similar content and verifying that generated test cases reference or incorporate patterns from previous similar issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a vector database containing historical test cases and issue patterns, **When** a new issue is created, **Then** the system retrieves the top 5 most relevant historical test cases for context
2. **Given** retrieved context from the vector database, **When** test case generation occurs, **Then** the generated test cases incorporate relevant patterns and avoid duplication
3. **Given** an issue with ambiguous requirements, **When** similar historical issues exist, **Then** the system uses those patterns to make informed assumptions documented in the test cases

---

### User Story 3 - Webhook Security and Request Validation (Priority: P3)

The system securely receives webhook requests from GitHub, validates the authenticity using signature verification, and processes only legitimate requests to prevent unauthorized access or malicious triggers.

**Why this priority**: Essential for production security but can be simplified or deferred for initial MVP testing in controlled environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending webhook requests with valid and invalid signatures, verifying that only authenticated requests are processed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a webhook request from GitHub, **When** the request includes a valid signature, **Then** the system processes the webhook and triggers test case generation
2. **Given** a webhook request with an invalid or missing signature, **When** the system receives the request, **Then** the request is rejected with appropriate logging
3. **Given** a webhook request for an unsupported event type, **When** the system receives the request, **Then** the request is acknowledged but no action is taken

---

### Edge Cases

#### Insufficient Information Handling

- **What happens when an issue is created without sufficient information for test case generation?** → System posts a comment on the issue requesting more detail with a template, skips generation, and marks the ProcessingJob as SKIPPED with reason "insufficient_information"
- **Insufficient information criteria**: Issue body < 50 characters, or missing feature description, or no clear acceptance criteria

#### Concurrent Processing

- **How does the system handle concurrent issue creation (multiple issues created simultaneously)?** → Each webhook creates an independent ProcessingJob. Jobs execute in parallel up to system capacity (100 concurrent). Queue overflow (>100) triggers backpressure with 429 responses to GitHub (which will retry)

#### Rate Limiting & API Failures

- **What happens if the GitHub API rate limit is exceeded during PR creation?** → System calculates wait time until rate limit reset, queues the job for automatic retry, and posts a comment to the issue indicating the estimated wait time (typically <60 minutes)
- **How does the system handle failure to create a branch or pull request due to permissions?** → System posts a detailed comment explaining required permissions (Contents: Read & Write), marks job as FAILED, and alerts repository administrator if notification configured

#### Database Unavailability

- **What happens when the vector database is unavailable or returns no relevant context?** → System continues in degraded mode without historical context retrieval, logs the failure, generates test cases based solely on issue description, and posts a warning comment about reduced quality expectations
- **What happens when Redis cache is unavailable?** → System skips idempotency check (accepts risk of duplicate PRs if webhook redelivery occurs), logs degraded mode, and alerts operations team

#### Character Limits & Truncation

- **Issues with descriptions exceeding 5,000 characters** are truncated with a warning comment added to the issue indicating the truncation and original character count
- **What happens when issue body exactly equals 5,000 characters?** → No truncation occurs (5,000 is inclusive limit), full content is processed

#### Retry & Timeout Behavior

- **If the AI service fails or times out during generation**, the system retries up to 3 times using exponential backoff (5s, 15s, 45s delays), then comments failure on the issue if all retries are exhausted with troubleshooting steps
- **What happens when retry exponential backoff overlaps with webhook timeout?** → Initial webhook response returns 202 Accepted immediately, actual processing happens asynchronously. Retries do not block webhook response
- **What happens if PR creation succeeds but comment posting fails?** → Job marked as PARTIALLY_COMPLETE, background retry attempts comment posting once after 5 minutes. PR link is still visible in GitHub UI even without comment

#### Idempotency & Duplicate Handling

- **Duplicate webhook deliveries** are detected using an idempotency cache that tracks processed issue+event combinations for 1 hour, preventing duplicate PR creation
- **What happens when identical issues are created within the 1-hour idempotency window?** → Each unique issue (different issue number) is processed independently. Idempotency only prevents duplicate events for the SAME issue number

#### Tag Management

- **What happens when "generate-tests" tag is removed after processing starts?** → Job continues to completion (tag check happens at webhook receipt only). Removal does not cancel in-flight processing

#### Branch & PR Edge Cases

- **What happens if branch name already exists?** → System appends timestamp to branch name (e.g., test-cases/issue-123-20251026153045) and posts comment noting the unique branch name

## Assumptions

### A1: GitHub Repository Permissions

**Assumption**: GitHub repository has appropriate permissions configured for the system to create branches and pull requests

**Validation**: System requires GitHub App with permissions: `contents: write`, `pull_requests: write`, `issues: write`, `metadata: read`

**Impact if Invalid**: System cannot create branches or PRs; error E405 (permission denied) posted to issue

**Mitigation**: Pre-deployment permission verification script validates all required scopes

### A2: Webhook Endpoint Connectivity

**Assumption**: Webhook endpoint is accessible via Cloudflare Tunnel with stable connectivity

**Validation**: Cloudflare Tunnel health check endpoint returns 200 OK; monthly uptime >99.9% per SC-005

**Impact if Invalid**: GitHub webhooks fail delivery; fallback to manual trigger via API endpoint `/admin/retry/{issue_number}`

**Mitigation**: Cloudflare Tunnel automatic reconnection; alerting on connectivity loss >5 minutes

### A3: Vector Database Pre-Population

**Assumption**: Vector database is pre-populated with an initial set of test case examples (minimum 50 diverse examples covering web, API, UI, integration, security test types)

**Validation**: Startup check verifies embedding count ≥50; vector DB returns similarity scores >0.5 for sample queries

**Impact if Invalid**: AI generation lacks context; quality may drop below SC-007 threshold (85% accuracy); system proceeds with warning

**Mitigation**: Seed script `scripts/seed-vector-db.py` populates initial dataset from `examples/` directory; requires manual review of examples

### A4: AI Service Quota and Rate Limits

**Assumption**: AI service (Llama 3.2 via Ollama local server) has sufficient capacity for expected usage (100 concurrent requests per SC-002, avg 30s generation time = 3.3 requests/sec sustained)

**Validation**: Load test validates 100 concurrent requests with <10% timeout rate (E301); memory usage <4GB per container

**Impact if Invalid**: Generation timeouts exceed retry threshold; errors E301 posted to issues; queue backlog increases

**Mitigation**: Horizontal scaling to 3 AI service replicas; queue depth alerting at >50 pending jobs

### A5: Standard Test Case Format

**Assumption**: Standard Markdown format for test cases is defined in `test-case-template.md` and accepted by development team

**Validation**: Generated test cases conform to template structure (Given-When-Then sections present, minimum 5 scenarios per SC-003)

**Impact if Invalid**: PRs rejected during review; rework required; developer satisfaction drops below SC-009 threshold (4/5)

**Mitigation**: Template validation in AI generation prompt; quality checklist in PR description; feedback loop for template refinement

### A6: Tag Naming Convention

**Assumption**: "generate-tests" tag naming convention is established and communicated to development team via repository documentation and issue templates

**Validation**: Webhook filter matches exact string "generate-tests" (case-sensitive); documented in repository CONTRIBUTING.md

**Impact if Invalid**: Issues with misspelled tags (e.g., "generate-test", "generate_tests") are skipped; no error notification sent

**Mitigation**: GitHub issue template includes "generate-tests" label pre-selected; documentation provides examples

### A7: Git Workflow Convention

**Assumption**: Repository follows conventional Git workflow with `main` or `master` branch as base (detected via GitHub API default branch)

**Validation**: System queries repository default branch on startup; PR creation uses detected base branch

**Impact if Invalid**: PRs created against wrong branch; merge conflicts; workflow disruption

**Mitigation**: Configuration override via environment variable `BASE_BRANCH`; error E404 if base branch unreachable

### A8: Single Repository Scope

**Assumption**: System operates within a single GitHub repository per deployment instance (multi-repo support is future enhancement)

**Validation**: Webhook signature verification scoped to repository from environment variable `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`

**Impact if Invalid**: N/A (architectural constraint for MVP)

**Mitigation**: Documentation clarifies single-repo deployment model; future multi-tenant design in roadmap

### A9: Historical Test Case Format Consistency

**Assumption**: Historical test cases are stored in consistent Markdown format compatible with vector embedding (files in `tests/` directory with `.md` extension)

**Validation**: Embedding script validates Markdown structure (headings, code blocks); skips malformed files with warning log

**Impact if Invalid**: Vector DB context quality degrades; similarity scores drop below 0.7 threshold per SC-006

**Mitigation**: One-time migration script `scripts/normalize-test-format.py` converts legacy formats; manual review of 10% sample

### A10: Vector Database Retention Policy

**Assumption**: Vector database retains test case embeddings for 30 days to balance storage costs with context retrieval quality (configurable via `VECTOR_DB_RETENTION_DAYS`)

**Validation**: Daily cron job (2 AM UTC per orphaned branch cleanup schedule) purges embeddings older than retention period; storage usage <10GB

**Impact if Invalid**: Storage costs increase; query performance degrades; retrieval latency exceeds 500ms per FR-028

**Mitigation**: Alerting on storage usage >8GB; retention period adjustment based on cost/quality tradeoff analysis

## Out of Scope

- Manual test case editing or approval workflow within the system (handled in GitHub PR review)
- Integration with test execution frameworks or CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-language test case generation (initial support for English only)
- Custom AI model training or fine-tuning (uses pre-trained models)
- Real-time collaboration or live editing of test cases
- Advanced permissions or role-based access control beyond GitHub repository permissions
- Test case versioning or historical tracking (relies on Git history)
- Integration with project management tools beyond GitHub Issues
- Support for multiple AI model providers beyond Llama 3.2 (single model stack for MVP simplicity)
