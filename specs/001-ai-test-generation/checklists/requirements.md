# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Test Case Generation System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality criteria have been met. The specification:

- Clearly defines 3 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- Includes 15 functional requirements that are testable and unambiguous
- Defines 10 measurable success criteria that are technology-agnostic
- Identifies 8 edge cases for robust testing
- Lists key entities involved in the system
- Documents assumptions and out-of-scope items
- Focuses on WHAT and WHY without leaking HOW (implementation)

The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed to implementation planning.
