## Summary

**Total Items**: 125 checklist items  
**Coverage**: Comprehensive validation across all requirement quality dimensions  
**Risk Focus**: AI quality, Security, Performance, Operational resilience (all equally critical)  
**Traceability**: 87% of items include spec/plan references or gap markers (109/125)

**Key Gaps Identified**:

- AI generation quality validation and prompt templates
- Vector DB operational requirements (index maintenance, backup/restore)
- Security details (secret rotation, token storage, rate limiting)
- Recovery and resilience procedures (job resumption, cleanup)
- Observability infrastructure (metrics, alerting, tracing)
- External dependency versioning and compatibility

**Recommended Actions**:

1. Address HIGH priority gaps: CHK009, CHK073-076 (recovery), CHK082-088 (security)
2. Clarify ambiguous metrics: CHK028-040 (measurability)
3. Document missing templates: CHK010, CHK015, CHK124
4. Validate assumptions: CHK104-108 (external dependencies)
5. Resolve conflicts: CHK110, CHK115-117

**Usage**: Review each item before implementation. Mark complete when requirement is validated, clarified, or gap is addressed with updated documentation.
