2. **Enhance Specification**: Add missing security, recovery, performance, observability requirements
3. **Update Planning Documents**: Performance boundaries, data model fields, security setup
4. **Formalize Ambiguities**: Transform vague edge cases into structured categories with criteria
5. **Document Assumptions**: Clarify validation criteria, impact analysis, mitigation strategies

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Run `/speckit.implement`** to start implementation
   - Pre-implementation checklist now shows 47/125 complete
   - Sufficient coverage for Phase 0-1 (Setup, Core Generation MVP)

2. **Create Task Breakdown** via `/speckit.tasks`
   - Estimated 80-100 tasks across 4 phases
   - Test-first approach (write tests before implementation)
   - Dependency-ordered with parallel execution opportunities

3. **Begin Phase 0: Setup**
   - Repository initialization
   - Development environment setup
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Dependency installation

### Future Gap Closure (Iterative)

**Phase 1 Implementation** (after MVP complete):

- Expand scenario coverage based on real issues
- Document test strategy after pytest integration
- Generate traceability matrix from task completion

**Phase 2 Implementation** (after production deployment):

- Refine NFRs based on production metrics
- Update edge cases based on real-world incidents
- Expand error catalog with newly discovered errors

**Phase 3 Implementation** (after 3 months production):

- Comprehensive acceptance criteria documentation
- Full traceability matrix with test coverage
- Performance optimization based on load patterns

### Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Track Deferred Items** during implementation:

- Create GitHub issues for deferred checklist items
- Label with "documentation", "enhancement", "post-mvp"
- Prioritize based on production needs and team capacity
- Review quarterly for relevance (some may become obsolete)

**Success Metrics**:

- Implementation rework rate <10% (indicates sufficient upfront clarity)
- Production incidents <5/month (indicates adequate error handling)
- Developer satisfaction ≥4/5 (indicates documentation quality)
