**Recovery**: User must verify GitHub webhook secret matches server configuration

---

### E102: Missing Required Tag

**Severity**: LOW  
**HTTP Status**: 200 OK (Acknowledged but not processed)

**Internal Message**: `Issue #{issue_number} does not contain required tag 'generate-tests'`

**User-Facing Message**: None (silent skip)

**Action**:
- Log event
- Return 200 OK
- Do not create ProcessingJob

**Recovery**: User adds "generate-tests" tag to issue

---

### E103: Issue Body Exceeds Character Limit

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**HTTP Status**: 200 OK (Processed with truncation)

**Internal Message**: `Issue #{issue_number} body exceeds 5000 chars (actual: {actual_chars}), truncating`

**User-Facing Message** (GitHub comment):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice**: Your issue description was truncated to 5,000 characters for processing. 
The test cases below are based on the truncated content. For complete coverage, 
consider breaking this into multiple smaller issues.

Original length: {actual_chars} characters  
Processed length: 5,000 characters
```

**Action**:
- Truncate to 5000 chars
- Post warning comment
- Continue processing
- Log truncation

**Recovery**: None needed, graceful degradation

---

### E104: Insufficient Information

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**HTTP Status**: 200 OK

**Internal Message**: `Issue #{issue_number} lacks sufficient detail for test case generation`

**User-Facing Message** (GitHub comment):
```
üëã Hi @{author}!

I attempted to generate test cases for this issue, but I need more information. 
Could you please provide:

- Clear description of the feature or functionality
- Expected behavior and acceptance criteria
- Any specific edge cases or error scenarios to consider
- Example inputs and expected outputs (if applicable)

Once you add these details, re-trigger generation by adding a comment with `/generate-tests`.

**Tip**: The more specific you are, the better the test cases will be! üéØ
```

**Action**:
- Post comment requesting details
- Mark ProcessingJob as SKIPPED (reason: "insufficient_information")
- Do not create PR

**Recovery**: User updates issue, manually re-triggers

---

**User-Facing Message** (after 3 retries, GitHub comment):
```
‚ùå **Test Case Generation Failed**

I tried to generate test cases for this issue 3 times, but the AI service timed out. 
This might be due to high load or a complex issue description.

**What you can do**:
1. Try again in a few minutes by commenting `/generate-tests`
2. Simplify your issue description to reduce processing time
3. Break complex features into smaller issues

If this persists, please contact support with issue #{issue_number}.
```

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Generation Quality Issue**

I generated test cases, but they didn't meet quality standards. I'll try again with 
different parameters.

Attempt {retry_count}/2

If this persists, the issue description might be ambiguous. Consider:
- Adding more specific acceptance criteria
- Including example inputs/outputs
- Clarifying expected behavior
```

**Action**:
- Parse validation errors (missing scenarios, invalid format, etc.)
- Retry generation with adjusted prompt

but couldn't create the pull request automatically.

**What you can do**:
1. [Create PR manually]({pr_url}) from branch `test-cases/issue-{issue_number}`
2. Or wait 5 minutes and I'll retry automatically

Test cases are ready in the branch! üéâ
```

**User-Facing Message** (GitHub comment):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Timeout**

Your test case generation job exceeded the maximum processing time (15 minutes) 
and has been cancelled.

This usually means:
- The issue description was extremely complex
- A temporary system issue occurred

Please try again. If this happens repeatedly, try simplifying your issue description.

**Tip**: Break large features into smaller, focused issues for better test case quality!
```

**Action**:
- Background job monitors ProcessingJob table every 5 minutes
- Find jobs in PROCESSING > 15 minutes
- Mark as FAILED with timeout reason
- Post timeout comment
- Log for investigation

**Recovery**: User retries; ops investigates if pattern

---

## Error Handling Patterns

### Retry Strategy (Exponential Backoff)

```python
retry_delays = [5, 15, 45]  # seconds
max_retries = 3

for attempt in range(1, max_retries + 1):
    try:
        result = operation()
        break
    except RetryableError as e:
        if attempt == max_retries:
            raise MaxRetriesExceeded(e)
        delay = retry_delays[attempt - 1]
        log.warning(f"Retry {attempt}/{max_retries} after {delay}s: {e}")
        time.sleep(delay)
```

### Graceful Degradation Hierarchy

1. **Full functionality**: All services healthy
2. **Degraded mode**: Missing context (E201, E202) - continue without vector DB
3. **Degraded mode**: Missing cache (E501) - skip idempotency check
4. **Delayed mode**: Rate limited (E401) - queue for later
5. **Failed mode**: Critical errors (E502, E503) - reject all requests

### Logging Standards

```python
log.error(
    error_code="E301",
    message="AI generation timeout",
    correlation_id=state.correlation_id,
    issue_number=state.issue_number,
    attempt=retry_count,
    duration_ms=elapsed_time,
    context={
        "issue_title": state.issue_title,
        "similar_cases_count": len(state.similar_cases),
        "prompt_tokens": token_count
    }
)
```
